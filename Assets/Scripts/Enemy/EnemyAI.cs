     A.I. takes a walking back and forth positions for them to do repeatedly, that can be inputed into the inspector in the form of a list of transforms can put as many as you want to

    Must have a vision cone for them to be able to detect the enemy going to be a cone or triangle that is a trigger, do we want them to react to the rock on the ground

    must also react to the sound a door makes if they can hear it

    Behavior when they look at a enemy is they play a gun shot sound and the player dies, do they react to clones?
    assuming yes
